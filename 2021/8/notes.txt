Segments length of each digit:
0: len 6
1: len 2
2: len 5
3: len 5
4: len 4
5: len 5
6: len 6
7: len 3
8: len 7
9: len 6

Re-written so that len equals a digit:
len 2 -> 1
len 3 -> 7
len 4 -> 4
len 5 -> 2, 3, 5
len 6 -> 0, 6, 9
len 7 -> 8

After studing the length and patterns of each number I've reached the following conclusion.

Knowing the combinations of 1, 4, 7, 8 we can find the other combinations:

STEP 1: discriminate 0, 6 and 9 (and distinguish them from the other numbers):
if length of signal is 6 -> result is one of 0, 6 or 9
if the signal contains a combination of 1 -> result is 0 or 9
                                otherwise -> result is 6
if the signal contains a combination of 3 -> result is 9
                                otherwise -> result is 0

STEP 2: discriminate between 2, 3 and 5:
if length of signal is 5 -> result is 2/3/5
if the signal contains a combination of 1 -> result is 3
                                otherwise -> result is 2 or 5
if adding a segment of the combination of 1 results in 9 -> result is 5
                                             otherwise   -> result is 2
--> notice that one segment of the 1 combination already needs to be present
    for the signal to become a 9 once you add the other segment
