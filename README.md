# ADVENT OF CODE

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a website that features an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles.

These are my solutions to the puzzles.

Please note that my skill set is going to improve from year to year, so you shouldn't judge my skills based on my previous years results.
> Also, keep in mind that 2021 is/was the first year that I've tried to "compete" in these kinds of puzzles.

Each puzzle is divided into two parts: part 1 and part 2.

For some puzzles I've decided to use two different scripts to solve them (the folder contains these files: ```part1.py``` and ```part2.py```) 
or one script that resolves both parts (the folder contains one file: ```both.py```).

## Topics/methods I used to solve puzzles

### 2021

* day 10: syntax checking using the stack
* day 11: OOP to memorize the number of steps a group of octopi need to synchronize
          and the number of flashes they do after 100 steps

## What I've learned/should learn more

This is a list of things that I've learned by watching others solutions.

### 2021

Libraries I should learn/study more for simpler and better solutions:
* scikit learn
* scipy
* numpy
* cv2 
* itertools
* collections
* math
* networkx

day 9:
* Graph traversal
* union-find
* K-nearest neighbors
* Depth-first search
* Breadth-first search

* [Flood fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill) algorithms could be used for the second part.

    A flood fill algorithm "determines and alters the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array with some matching attribute"
