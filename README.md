# ADVENT OF CODE

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a website that features an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles.

These are my solutions to the puzzles.

Each puzzle is divided into two parts: part 1 and part 2.

For some puzzles I've decided to use two different scripts to solve them (the folder contains these files: ```part1.py``` and ```part2.py```) 
or one script that resolves both parts (the folder contains one file: ```both.py```).
