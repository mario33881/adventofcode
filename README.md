# ADVENT OF CODE

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a website that features an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles.

These are my solutions to the puzzles.

Please note that my skill set is going to improve from year to year, so you shouldn't judge my skills based on my previous years results.
> Also, keep in mind that 2021 is/was the first year that I've tried to "compete" in these kinds of puzzles.

Each puzzle is divided into two parts: part 1 and part 2.

For some puzzles I've decided to use two different scripts to solve them (the folder contains these files: ```part1.py``` and ```part2.py```) 
or one script that resolves both parts (the folder contains one file: ```both.py```).
